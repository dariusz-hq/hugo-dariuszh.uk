## API Gateway Authentication Layer

**Description:** Researched and implemented a centralized authentication and authorization pattern using AWS API Gateway with custom Lambda authorizer for a fintech platform. This decoupled authentication/authorization logic from API implementations, enabling the development of new APIs in Go without having to re-engineer session management, OAuth2 server, and authorization mechanisms. Created strategy document with guidelines for API development. Simplified authorization mechanisms while maintaining security requirements.

**Technologies:** AWS API Gateway, Lambda, PHP, Bref

## Platform Migration System

**Description:** Led engineering effort to build a sophisticated multi-staged migration system for a fintech platform, enabling seamless transfer of thousands of users and their financial data from external technology platforms. The system handled complex data transformations, validation, and reconciliation processes while maintaining data integrity throughout the migration. This tool became a key differentiator in the competitive landscape.

**Technologies:** PHP, Yii2, Yii1, MySQL, AWS (SQS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, S3)

## Identity & Access Management (IAM) System

**Description:** Designed and implemented an IAM system for a fintech platform's APIs, providing granular permission controls for different client types. The system enabled fine-grained access control to specific API resources, supporting secure first-party integrations and mobile applications while maintaining compliance requirements.

**Technologies:** PHP, Yii2

## Employer Portal MVP

**Description:** Built a full-stack MVP from ground up enabling employers to manage employee payroll contributions for a pensions platform. Developed React frontend application, RESTful APIs, and backend processes including enrollments, payment processing, contribution management, and opt-outs. The portal streamlined employer workflows and reduced manual administrative overhead.

**Technologies:** React, Material Design, PHP, Yii2, MySQL, AWS (SQS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, S3)

## OAuth2 Authentication Implementation

The implementation enabled secure mobile app authentication while also providing the foundation for external integrations with third-party services like voice assistants.

**Technologies:** PHP, Yii2

## Embeddable Widget Platform

**Description:** Developed an embeddable widget system as an alternative to traditional SSO mechanisms for a fintech platform. The widget enabled seamless integration into client websites, allowing end users to access financial services without leaving their employer's portal. Implemented secure token-based authentication using JWE/JWS standards.

**Technologies:** React, JavaScript, JWE/JWS, PHP, Yii2, MySQL

## Modern RESTful API

**Description:** Developed a modern RESTful API to replace legacy systems for a fintech platform. The new API supported mobile app development, accelerated first-party integrations, and provided OpenAPI documentation. Significantly improved developer experience and reduced time-to-market for new features.

**Technologies:** PHP, Yii1, Yii2, MySQL, Swagger, Apache

## E-Commerce Platform

**Description:** Served as one of the lead engineers developing an automotive e-commerce platform that became the company's flagship product.
