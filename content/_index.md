Hello, I'm Dariusz and welcome to my personal website!  

I'm a Staff Engineer with over 10 years of experience building and scaling fintech systems. I've worked across the full
stack—from architecting backend services to developing modern frontend applications—delivering solutions that serve
hundreds of thousands of users and handle billions in assets.  

My experience spans system architecture, technical leadership, and hands-on development in highly regulated
environments. I've led initiatives including platform migrations, OAuth2 authentication systems, RESTful APIs, and
employer portals. I'm skilled at both building greenfield projects and modernizing legacy systems, having driven major
upgrades across PHP versions, containerization, and database platforms.  

I work primarily with PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and AWS infrastructure, with growing experience in Go. Beyond
coding, I mentor engineers, establish technical standards, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate
business requirements into scalable technical solutions.  

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computing & IT and Business from The Open University and stay current through continuous
learning. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing guitar, on the tennis or basketball court, or spending time with
my family.  

I'm interested in opportunities that value practical solutions, technical excellence, and continuous innovation.
