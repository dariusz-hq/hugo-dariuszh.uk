Hello, I'm Dariusz and welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in designing, developing, and implementing software
solutions. I work with a range of programming languages and technologies to create reliable and scalable applications.

My experience covers various projects, from small internal web applications, embeddable widgets, APIs and large
back-office web applications and batch job processors. I enjoy solving technical challenges and improving user
experiences through thoughtful software design.
I collaborate well with cross-functional teams, ensuring that business requirements are clearly translated into
functional software. I am dedicated to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computing & IT and Business from The Open University, and I keep my skills sharp through
ongoing professional development. In my spare time, I enjoy playing one of my guitars or being active playing tennis,
basketball or spending time with my family.

I look forward to applying my skills in a dynamic organization that values practical solutions and innovation.
